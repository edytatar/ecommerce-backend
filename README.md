  E-commerce generated an estimated $29 trillion in 2019 and is the largest sector of the electronics industry. 

  This application is the backend for an e-commerce site. It configures an Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. 
  
  A user is able to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE categories, products, and tags.
